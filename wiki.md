# Testing out my understanding of Markdown
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Markdown-mark.svg/1200px-Markdown-mark.svg.png)

I happen to know a decent amount about it because, unbeknownst to me, I've been using it online here and there.

## What are some things I already knew how to do?
- I could *italicize* words
- I could **embolden** words
- I could ***do both*** at the same time
- I could ~~strikethrough~~ words
- I could go ~~***absolutely hog wild***~~ with words
- I could post images (see above)
- I could create unordered lists
- I could post [links](https://github.com/jakobzhao/geog495/tree/main/labs/lab01)
- I could create ordered lists (not found on this page, though)

## That sure is a lot. Is there anything else?
Yes.

## Like what?
Blockquotes.

## What do those look like?
> Like this.

## Anything else after that?
Not really.

## One more thing. I'd like to see just how many links you can make.
I could, in theory, make as many links as there are webpages in existence, but that sounds tedious. Here are a few things I'd rather do:

- Learn to play the [piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano)
- Play with a useless [children's toy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-yo)
- Closely examine some [gravel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel)
